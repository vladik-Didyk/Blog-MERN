# Backend:

* The process starts with understanding backend theory and developing an application using Express.
* Key aspects include setting up a modular approach for NodeJS, creating an authentication system, and  integrating JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* Connecting to a MongoDB database, creating a user model, and managing user authentication are also crucial steps.
* Other important features involve handling errors, securing user data, and implementing CRUD functionality for articles.
* The backend segment concludes with image upload handling using Multer and a final refactoring of the backend code.

# Frontend:

* The frontend development begins with examining the project structure and integrating React Router and Redux Toolkit.
* Configuring Axios, fixing CORS errors, and creating asynchronous actions in Redux Toolkit are essential steps.
* Fetching and displaying articles and tags from the backend, as well as implementing user authentication features, are also important.
* The process continues with the creation of various forms, including registration, article creation, and editing.
* Lastly, image uploading, sending articles to the backend, rendering articles using React Markdown, and implementing article deletion and editing features are covered.
